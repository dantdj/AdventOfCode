I'll be honest, I just wanted to get this one over and done with - it's some horrendous code.

Here be demons.
Enter at your own risk.
Etc

My original intention here was to find the symbols and then find the numbers around them instead of the other way around, which would
have resulted in a _much_ easier time with part 2, as then it would have just been a matter of recording the number of adjacent numbers.
However, I dropped thisplan as I couldn't figure out how to handle multiple numbers on one line surrounding the symbol.
I might come back to this, but if this notice is still here then assume I haven't!
