The solution for part 2 is currently a naive application of the solution from part 1,
but on a _drastically_ increased input size. As such, it takes close to 10 minutes to run on my machine.

I'd like to come back and fix this up, but it'll depend on the time I have available to me.

Update: Brought it down to around 5 minutes with the changes made in the commit that introduced this line.
