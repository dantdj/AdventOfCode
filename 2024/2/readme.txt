This is a bit naive (brute-force) and I'm not happy with it, but it does the trick. It'd be nice to figure out the way to handle it so only the bad levels trigger a proper review.

It should be possible to add a small optimization to make it so only reports that have unsafe levels are checked, instead of checking even known safe reports.
